//  Created by Joshua Greene on 4/2/14.
//
//  This project builds on `BlockRSSParser` by Thibaut LE LEVIER, see
//  https://github.com/tibo/BlockRSSParser for the Git repository.
//
//  For the RSS 2.0 specification, see http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html
//  for reference.
//
//  Note, however, that Media RSS is *not* part of the RSS 2.0. Rather, it is a
//  namespace extension to RSS 2.0. For the Media RSS specification
//  (currently v. 1.5.1 is used by this project), see
//  http://www.rssboard.org/media-rss for reference.
